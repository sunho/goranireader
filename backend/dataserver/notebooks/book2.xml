         <sentence id="8824add2-dc51-11e9-8285-48bf6beb4102" start="true">From then on, the years flew.</sentence>
         <sentence id="8824b05c-dc51-11e9-8285-48bf6beb4102" start="false">Corrie continued to write books, travel to countless countries, and even oversee the film they made of The Hiding Place.</sentence>
         <sentence id="8824b4a8-dc51-11e9-8285-48bf6beb4102" start="false">But time was catching up with her, and after several strokes, her tired body finally gave out.</sentence>
