      "['” latina ’ s face truly looked happy as he said those words and suddenly hugged her . if this were a plot to make me drop the matter , then that ’ d be an ominous premonition ... but if it were an ugly , wicked woman who was trying to deceive me , it would be no problem ! if this were a plot to make me drop the matter , then that ’ d be an ominous premonition ... but if it were an ugly , wicked woman who was trying to deceive me , it would be no problem ! regardless of these ridiculous thoughts , dale seemed to be truly blissful at this moment .', 'feeling dale ’ s palm on her back , her eyes shot open , and she responded with a serious look of determination on her face . “ latina will give it her all . she ’ ll be here with rita and kenneth . so please , come back . “ right , and i ’ ll bring a souvenir back with me . so take care , and watch the place for me . he gave her one last , firm hug and set her down . when they reached the entrance to the shop , kenneth took charge of latina . “ take care of latina , alright ? “ yeah . and you be sure not to push yourself too hard . he ’ d never seen dale respond with a smile like that before . “ right , i ’ m off .', 'the greatest taboo when it came to dale reki was treating him like a child . the dragon knight forced a nervous smile , not realizing that the man behind him couldn ’ t see his face , and kept on talking , hoping to turn the situation around . “ these are the talk of the capital nowadays ! they all have different flavors based on what color they are . and they come in all sorts of truly vibrant colors ! they ’ re like beautiful jewels , making them popular with everyone from commoners to nobles ! with that , the bottle was snatched from his hands . it seemed he had managed to grab the adventurer ’ s interest , at least for the time being . glimpsing a possible way out , the dragon knight decided to press further .', '“ ugh , what should i do , titi ? he ’ s supposed to be really hard to deal with ... ” the man grumbled to his partner next to him . the gentle-natured female dragon responded with a cry of “ coo ? coo ? as the pair wasn ’ t cut out for combat , their main duty was transporting goods and people , and because flying dragons weren ’ t suited for traveling in the dark , they had spent the night waiting here for their passenger , who wanted to go to the capital . “ apparently , he ’ s an adventurer who has a contract with the duke . i hear the knight i replaced offended him and got demoted to a frontier post ... we finally got a high-paying job in the capital , but ... ugh , are we gon na be alright ... ? his current mission was to escort that adventurer to the capital . that', '“ does it hurt ? are you alright ? ” asked latina . “ they ’ re fine ! just slap some spit on there and it ’ ll heal up fine ! “ no one asked you , chloe ! with a worried look on her face , latina squatted down and stared at the two boys chloe had beaten and kicked , rudy and marcel the round-faced boy . “ this is because latina didn ’ t respond ... she ’ s sorry ... “ it ’ s our fault for scaring you ... ” marcel said with a strained laugh , but latina only looked even more apologetic .', 'the powers of a demon lord were vast , and with their household alongside them , they possessed enough strength to prove a threat to a nation on their own . if a country were to oppose them in an official capacity , a demon lord would choose to fight back alongside his house . the seven demon lords were all independent , and they wouldn ’ t choose to form alliances . but even so , war with a single demon lord was more than enough to shake an entire nation down to its core . in order to hold back the threat of a demon lord with the least amount of risk , it was best to use a small group of unspecified alliance to launch a surprise attack . in other words : assassination . gregor was part of a ducal household , but because he wasn ’ t officially in the employ of the military and was at least partly thought of as an adventurer publicly at this point , the mission had come his way .', 'lined up one after another were houses that served both as residences and workshops . compared to the eastern district ’ s main street , it was an area with a more working-class sort of feel to it , with many complicated , crisscrossing alleyways ; to people other than residents , it may well have felt like a labyrinth . that was certainly the case for latina , who didn ’ t even understand how she got here , even when she looked back over her shoulder . what should latina do ? ” she muttered to herself , utterly at a loss . “ who are you ? hearing a voice from behind , latina jumped in surprise . when she turned around , she saw a group of boys standing around . they frowned at the sight of this girl they didn ’ t recognize .', '“ protect me ! ” yelled the demon woman , scolding her underlings . pushing through the rubble , a dragon came forward to defend her . shortly afterwards , fireballs came flying and hit the dragon in its head , scattering a great deal of heat through the surroundings . but that wasn ’ t the end of the magical assault . next up , an electrical shock came running across the ground . at this point , the woman ’ s primary goal would be to stop this wave of attacks coming from multiple magic users . the demon woman nervously realized that the soldiers under her command had been defeated so quickly by just two humans , and the rest of her dragons were still in the depths of that unbelievably deep hole . the one by her side now had only managed to crawl out by climbing over its brethren . she wouldn ’ t get the rest of them back so easily .', 'still , she had something to strive towards , so she managed to more or less pull herself together . as rita told him about how latina had been and what had happened in kreuz while he was away , the little girl returned from the kitchen . in her hands she firmly held a tray , on top of which there was a piping-hot shepherd ’ s pie and a brightly colored , jiggling gelatin desert filled with cut-up fruit . “ dale , latina made this . she worked hard so you could eat it . “ y-you made it , latina ? “ she gave it her all . as dale ’ s trembling hands took the tray from latina , who had a proud smile on her face , he was overcome with emotion . “ i can ’ t eat it ! that ’ d be such a waste ! ” he yelled .', 'his eyes lost all focus , and he hollowly murmured , “ h-half a month was too long , huh ... ? hehehe ... if i wipe all the demons from the face of the earth , then maybe i won ’ t need to leave her ever again ... “ you seem pretty worn out . ” realizing that he was showing this much fatigue even when he was indulging in his eccentricities , rita couldn ’ t help but sympathize . “ latina really did give it her all . i told her she could stay with us in our room ’ til you got back , thinking she ’ d feel too lonely if she was in that attic all by herself . but she just said , ‘ latina wants to stay in dale ’ s room . ’ she said she was fine sleeping alone too , because ‘ dale ’ s scent makes latina feel relaxed . “ latina was alright ? everything went fine ? “ well , she did seem lonely . still , she had something to strive towards , so she managed to more or less pull herself together .', 'taking that as their chance , the boys excitedly crowded around latina . “ that ’ s amazing ! you can use magic ? ! “ it really is incredible , to be able to use magic when you ’ re so young ! who taught you ? “ that ’ s the first time i ’ ve ever seen anyone use it ! seeing latina shake in response to their vigorous excitement , chloe took a step forward and shot them a glare . the boys stopped instantly , and latina peeked out from behind chloe ’ s back . “ amazing ? but latina can only use one simple healing spell , ” she said as she tilted her head in complete confusion . “ is using magic amazing ?', 'the adults realized that they ’ d been wrong due to their own preconceptions . “ is she growing slower because she ’ s a devil ? ” dale asked . “ i thought that too , and tried asking the regulars , but apparently devil kids grow at roughly the same rate as human children . everything slows down once they reach maturity , and they spend a long time as adults . “ latina ... is little ? “ you ’ re just small , ” commented dale . “ hmm ? seemingly truly confused by the adults all looking at her so seriously , latina once more tilted her head .', '“ oh earth and the spirits dwelling within you , by my name of dale reki i order you , shift your form according to my wishes , and swallow up all around you . 〈〈ground transfiguration〉〉 ” the mana called forth by this chant vastly eclipsed that of a basic spell . a thunderous roar filled the air , and the ground beneath his target collapsed . the demon woman and warriors realized the attack was coming in time to get out of the way , but the heavy dragons were caught up in the thick of it . if dale were a normal magic user , it wouldn ’ t have been strange for this attack to exhaust him completely , but he didn ’ t show even a hint of fatigue . in fact , he had smoothly unsheathed his blade , and cut his way into the midst of his confused enemies . with that signal , gregor , holding a scarlet , eastern longsword in his grasp , leaped into action as well .', 'if you want to meet her , then you ’ ve got ta come to our place . think about it , ” said dale arrogantly while he completely fawned over the girl . who the hell are you ? who the hell are you ? muttered gregor mentally , wondering who to blame for his friend ’ s change . “ even though we tried investigating latina with the akhdar ’ s message board , we couldn ’ t find any information about her . devil villages don ’ t interact with the outside much , and i guess that ’ s the sort of place she came from ... it ’ s real likely that she doesn ’ t have a single relative left to look for her . “ well , not much is known about devil culture , after all . “ i couldn ’ t find anything on her father ’ s body that ’ d hint at where they were from , so i can ’ t go looking for her home village . the ‘ crime ’ that got her branded with a broken horn must ’ ve been something out of her control .', 'just how much had this little girl locked away in her tiny body ? “ why didn ’ t you tell dale any of this stuff about yourself , latina ? ” he ’ d heard that when dale asked her before , she hadn ’ t seemed like she wanted to talk . so why was she opening up to kenneth like this ? in response to his question , latina said , “ if dale knew latina was bad , he ’ d hate her . latina ’ s ... scared of dale hating her ... “ i see . so you couldn ’ t talk to dale because he ’ s so important to you , huh ? because ” said kenneth , and latina nodded . even though dale had already guessed what she had just told him , he wanted this young girl to stay by his side . however , latina didn ’ t know that , and she was even scared of him knowing and wanted to hide it desperately .', '“ latina ’ s so cute that i just don ’ t want to go to work ! “ are you still saying that , you moron ? as dale uttered his typical line with a terribly serious look on his face , rita gave her normal , casual response back . “ i don ’ t waaaaaaanna ! i won ’ t make it back tonight , and i don ’ t even know how many days i ’ ll be gone ! how am i supposed to handle leaving latina so i can go deal with those demonic old geezers ? ! supposed', 'as dale turned to face rita , he looked as if a light had gone off in his head . “ you have to worry about sizes when it comes to clothes , and it wouldn ’ t be long before she ’ d outgrow them , so don ’ t go with that . oh right , she ’ s really fond of sweets , so how about taking a look at some famous shops in the capital ? “ souvenirs ... souvenirs , huh ... ? dale went to the capital for work so often that he hadn ’ t even considered the idea of buying souvenirs . the closest he got was when kenneth occasionally asked him to pick up things that were hard to get in kreuz while he was there . latina would be all smiles when she saw the latest popular sweets from the capital , and she ’ d definitely say , “ thank you ! ” in that cute voice of hers .', '” he yelled . “ no , you ’ ve got ta eat it . ” rita ’ s comebacks remained firm even after half a month . “ by the way , dale , we figured out something important while you were away . “ huh ? kenneth suddenly cut into the conversation just as dale was in the midst of enjoying the fruits of latina ’ s hard work , with the girl herself seated smiling on his lap . ignoring dale ’ s reaction , kenneth continued . “ just the other day , latina ’ s friend chloe told latina that they were going to school starting this fall , and asked if she ’ d come , too . “ what ?', '“ is it alright for latina to stay with dale forever ... ? “ if you disappeared , then dale would run around frantically looking for you . “ frantically ? ” questioned latina , tilting her head upon hearing a word she didn ’ t know . “ it means he ’ d be desperately worried . latina searched for words again . “ latina ... she got driven out of where she was born because she was bad . even though latina was the only one they threw out , rag went with her , and then he died . kenneth continued on with his work nonchalantly , trying his hardest to make sure she didn ’ t see him falter .', '“ for the time being , you at least need to still attend this evening ’ s party . it ’ s part of your job ... “ i don ’ t waaaaaanna ! i wan na go hooooome ! “ you need to look over the souvenir list the maids prepared , do you not ? it ’ s full of things that have been popular in the capital as of late , but it means nothing if you don ’ t choose one yourself , yes ? “ that ’ s right ! will latina be happy , i wonder ? dale ’ s expression shifted suddenly and completely , but gregor wasn ’ t particularly surprised . over the past half a month , he ’ d grown used to it . in fact , he ’ d come to accept all sorts of things , since he ’ d had no choice but to do so .', 'there was usually a market at the center of the plaza , so although the area was good for walking around and looking at goods , it wasn ’ t a suitable place to play . there was a park a short distance away , so that was where the children headed . the townsfolk also used it as a place to relax . as kreuz was a city , it was , of course , rather lacking in greenery , so even though the park was a man-made mix of grass , trees , and flowerbeds , it was always full of people enjoying a stroll , or the shouts of children having fun . there were quite a few children playing in the plaza that latina didn ’ t recognize . as she slipped past them and found her way to her friends , she lit up in a brilliant smile . “ what ’ s up , latina ? you look happy . “ did something good happen ?', 'when chloe and company headed back home , latina stood in the door to the shop , seeing them off by waving her hand . as the hour of saj approached , the regulars returned to the dancing ocelot , and latina bowed her head to each and every one of them . “ sorry for worrying you ... “ as long as you ’ re alright , then it ’ s no problem , little lady . thank you for looking for latina . ” latina gave another bow of her head to the regular , who laughed and waved it off . when he first returned to the shop , latina had greeted him with a smile , but now that he saw her from behind , it was obvious that she was disheartened . watching her pace back and forth to the entrance of the shop , he became depressed as well .', 'it was thanks to those circumstances that he had become close to a mere adventurer like dale . it also helped that they were the same age and recognized one another ’ s strengths , even if their specialties were different . “ rose isn ’ t even my fiancée to begin with . “ so about souvenirs ... i want to find something that ’ d make a little girl happy . you don ’ t know any young women besides that fiancée of yours , right ? “ alright , stand up . i ’ ll cut you down with a stroke of my blade . the “ fiancée ” dale was teasing him about was not someone he was actually engaged to . gregor and rose had loved one another since they were both young , but there were a great number of issues that stood in the way of them becoming officially engaged .', 'this young adventurer was skilled enough that he could cut down even the knight ’ s partner , titi , with a single swing of his sword . even if titi naturally wasn ’ t overly aggressive , she was still a dragon , so normal adventurers would have needed to come at her as a team . “ under order of his excellency , duke eldstedt , i have come here to meet you ! “ right . i ’ m dale reki , ” responded the young man to the knight ’ s low , quiet voice , perfectly relaxed as he looked over him and his partner . feeling an aura he couldn ’ t hope to match coming off the adventurer , who looked even younger than he was , the dragon knight gulped . “ please , come this way . after guiding him to the saddle on titi ’ s back , the knight took the luggage the man had brought and tied it down securely . though the saddle on a flying dragon was far , far higher up than it would be on a horse , the young man easily pulled himself up without losing his balance .', 'it doesn ’ t quite look like gold or silver . “ if a girl like her moved in , then there ’ s no way we wouldn ’ t have heard rumors about it . “ then you ’ re an outsider ? ! when latina heard the gruff tone of rudy ’ s voice , she recoiled again . why is he mad ? is ... latina strange , somehow ? why is he mad ? is ... latina strange , somehow ? what should latina do ... ? latina doesn ’ t know why he ’ s mad . what should latina do ... ? latina doesn ’ t know why he ’ s mad . “ that ’ s not cool , rudy . you made her cry . “ she ’ s the one who won ’ t talk , even though we ’ re asking her questions !', 'there was a young man walking through the depths of the forest . even though the sun was still out , this forest , untouched by humans , remained dim and gloomy . aside from the occasional chirping of birds , there were no sounds to be heard . the place definitely had an oppressive atmosphere to it . with a look of great displeasure on his face , the man glanced down at the sword in his hand . “ ugh , damn it ... ” he spat , wiping his blade off on some nearby grass . the sword was absolutely coated with a foul-smelling mucus .', '“ well , that ’ s true . that ’ s what it meant to live by the sword . magical beasts weren ’ t the only things that hurt people . it certainly wasn ’ t rare for human nations to clash with other races , and out of all those races , devils had the deepest ties with the demon lords . across the world there were seven demon lords , and they were ranked as “ first demon lord , ” “ second demon lord , ” and so on . their abilities and the way they ran things varied , but they all had one thing in common : all demon lords had horns , just like devils . furthermore , all demon lords led a household of “ demons . ” no one was born a demon . instead , they became one upon entering a demon lord ’ s house and gaining power far exceeding what they would naturally possess .', 'that ’ s why i called for you , ” gregor said , meeting dale ’ s gaze . “ i ’ ll tag along , ” dale said with a sigh . “ if you ’ re there , then i guess it ’ ll be fine ... they were so deeply confident in each other ’ s skills that they each trusted the other to watch their back . dale stood up . the time for his audience with the duke was drawing near . going in his usual leather coat would be inappropriate for such an event , so he needed to put on a more proper outfit . that was why he ’ d stopped here before heading to meet the duke in his office at the palace . it wasn ’ t just so he could have this chat with his friend . “ at any rate , be sure to keep yourself together and act a bit more dignified in front of my father .', 'after all , to dale , this palace was yet another battlefield .', 'the shop in the southern district faced out on the street , and it had a more wholesome feel to it than the other stores that served adventurers . but even so , it was no place for children to be playing . and yet , dale started to see children in the area as of late , which he found odd . but when he heard the story from kenneth , rita , and latina , he figured out what was happening . the children from the eastern district had been coming to pick up latina , who was unfamiliar with the town , playing with her , and then escorting her back when they were done . apparently , the kids also knew that this part of the southern district wasn ’ t entirely safe , so they always came as a group . it ’ s not as though dale thought it ’ d be alright to keep latina in the shop forever , and he had also been worried that she was only interacting with adults like himself . and in that way , these children from the eastern district were a godsend .', '“ dale , take care . be careful on your work ! while thoroughly savoring those words from latina , dale set off from the town of kreuz . ... right , i ’ ll give it my all . ... right , i ’ ll give it my all . the trip from kreuz to ausblick , the capital of the nation of laband , was three days by horse or one week by carriage . the road was well-maintained , as it was an important route for the country and a great number of merchants and travelers came and went along it . however , dale was heading in the direction of the woods on the outskirts of town , rather than towards this grand highway .', 'when latina at last returned , surrounded by the children from the eastern district , the sun had not yet set . “ rita ! ” latina passed through the door with a smile and ran towards her , only to stop suddenly . “ rita , latina ’ s sorry she got lost ... where ’ s kenneth ? “ he ’ s worrying about you . go show him that you ’ re back , ” rita replied , pointing towards the kitchen . to be honest , the sight of her husband being so worried about latina that he couldn ’ t properly concentrate on his work had left her at a loss . when he saw latina hurrying towards the kitchen , kenneth dropped the pot he was holding . a loud crashing sound filled the air . “ kenneth , latina ’ s sorry . she got lost , so she couldn ’ t keep her promise ...', 'even though he wasn ’ t that doting idiot dale , he still wanted to do something for this girl after hearing her say “ please . ” she was just too cute . not long afterwards : “ here , it ’ s a shepherd ’ s pie . i ’ ll give you a discount , so eat it . “ so you ’ ve finally started using high-pressure sales techniques here , huh ? kenneth stood dauntingly before the bearded adventurer who was a regular , holding a plate with an item he hadn ’ t ordered . he remained unshaken , even with the regular ’ s astonished response . “ and why is it so misshapen ? and aren ’ t the insides leaking out ?', 'latina didn ’ t meet other people much , and she didn ’ t talk to them . she was usually with her family , ” answered latina , getting a little depressed in the process . this seemed about the right place to stop . after all , these didn ’ t seem to be happy memories for her . having decided that , dale was about to put an end to the discussion . “ that ’ s why latina ’ s so happy now , because she gets to spend lots of time with dale . ” the words that she said , while seeming to somewhat embarrass her , landed a critical hit . the smile she gave dale now wouldn ’ t lose out to even the one she made when eating her beloved sweets . “ latina likes chloe , but she loves dale lots and lots more . “ i love you too , latina ! you really are cute ! ” latina ’ s face truly looked happy as he said those words and suddenly hugged her .', '“ where are you from ? i ’ ve never seen you before , ” said the biggest boy in the group while steadily approaching latina . not knowing how to reply , she retreated a bit in order to distance herself . seeing that , the expression on his face only grew more and more distrusting . the large boy named rudy , the quiet boy next to him with a round face , and the boy behind him with light-brown hair spoke in turn . “ i ’ ve never seen hair that color before . are you the kid of some sort of noble ? “ that ’ s not it , rudy . if she were , she ’ d be wearing a gown . “ that ’ s right . but still , her hair ’ s an unusual color . it doesn ’ t quite look like gold or silver .', 'in an open meadow outside of kreuz , there was a large beast resting its wings—a flying dragon . flying dragons were considered small for a subspecies of dragons , which were classified as magical beasts . in addition , they possessed the ability to fly , which other dragons did not have . even for a flying dragon , the specimen in this field was rather tiny , and from the scarlet equipment attached to its body , it was obvious even from a distance that it was in the service of the country of laband . by its side was a young man pacing back and forth , unable to calm his nerves . the man ’ s clothes were the same scarlet color the dragon was wearing . that uniform and his simple , jet-black armor identified him as a dragon knight , with the ability to control a flying dragon using the rare magical attribute of “ center .', 'when it came to adventurers , guys like that would be considered less than second-rate . but latina ’ s big eyes would just go wide in surprise , and she ’ d distance herself from them . then she ’ d observe them from far away , like she ’ d found some sort of large , strange creature . “ welcome ! thanks for waiting ! latina ’ s special shepherd ’ s pie was in great demand at the dancing ocelot again today . nearly half a month after dale had departed from kreuz , a shout of “ i can finally leave ! ” rang out through the eldstedt residence . “ i ’ m leaving right now ! get a flying dragon here asap ! latina ’ s waiting for me !', 'using both the wind mana that enveloped her and the traits she possessed as a natural-born flier , the dragon lifted her giant frame off the ground with a single flap of her wings . with a second flap , she soared high into the heavens , and with a third , she began moving towards the capital . at a flying dragon ’ s speed , the journey to the capital wouldn ’ t take more than half a day . that was one of the reasons those capable of serving as dragon knights were paid a high salary . methods for flying through the air were extremely limited . it was impossible to accomplish with magic alone , and so it was a special privilege limited to those who were born to fly through the heavens . as a result , it was considered a talent of particular military significance and was strictly regulated . when it came to flying dragons , the nation held a great deal of authority over things like breeding laws and the maintenance of specialized tools , such as their reins .', 'during this half a month , an elite group that included dale and gregor had headed into the mountains on the outskirts of ausblick in order to take down members of the seventh demon lord ’ s household . it was only just the other day that they had completed their mission and returned to the capital . the work that dale primarily received from duke eldstedt , which were jobs involving a contract from the country of laband , involved fighting against demon lords and their households . there was a reason only an elite few were sent on such jobs . by primarily employing adventurers , the country could avoid having to mobilize the army . if laband used its armed forces , it would be like a declaration of war on the demon lord . the powers of a demon lord were vast , and with their household alongside them , they possessed enough strength to prove a threat to a nation on their own .', 'each and every one of them had horns on their heads . devil warrior helmets were specially made , so as not to conceal the horns that they were so proud of ; while they covered the wearer ’ s head , their horns remained on full display . the most dangerous one in the group , though , was the robed woman . there ’ s no mistaking it . that woman ’ s a demon , ” dale quietly warned his allies . knowing his skill , they immediately accepted what he ’ d said rather than bothering with unnecessary questions . from there on out , they didn ’ t bother with any pointless conversation . as a group that had taken on dangerous missions together numerous times , they had naturally prepared a number of hand signals in advance . it was dale ’ s magic that kicked off the battle .', 'thinking about it , i ’ ve actually never bought candy for latina before . if she put one in her mouth , her little cheeks would puff out , right ? and the colors are pretty , which seems like the sort of thing that ’ d make a girl happy . when i bought latina hair accessories , she was fixated on the sparkly ones . even if she ’ s tiny , she ’ s still a girl , so i ’ m sure she ’ d like them . oh right , one of latina ’ s friends is a girl , too . i ’ ll need to get some for her as well . latina would probably be happy if she and her friend got the same thing . and then ... thinking about it , i ’ ve actually never bought candy for latina before . if she put one in her mouth , her little cheeks would puff out , right ? and the colors are pretty , which seems like the sort of thing that ’ d make a girl happy . when i bought latina hair accessories , she was fixated on the sparkly ones . even if she ’ s tiny , she ’ s still a girl , so i ’ m sure she ’ d like them . oh right , one of latina ’ s friends is a girl , too . i ’ ll need to get some for her as well . latina would probably be happy if she and her friend got the same thing . and then ... at the very least , the dragon knight would ’ ve realized he was far more on-edge than he needed to be in regards to dale during this trip to the capital . there ’ s no doubt that if dale was still his old self , what the dragon knight had done would ’ ve been like stepping right on a landmine . but to dale now , the offense was slight enough that it wasn ’ t even worth thinking about . the adventurer just didn ’ t have enough space in his mind for such things nowadays . though no one would ever know it , latina had helped save the future of a single young man with great promise .', 'in order to have her improve as quickly as possible , it was best to have her make as many as possible . there was a limit to how many meals they needed for lodgers , but this shop was also a gathering for men who were unrefined and didn ’ t fuss over things like how beautifully their meals were plated , so it made for the perfect testing ground . shepherd ’ s pie is a dish made by spreading mashed potatoes on top of a meat sauce and then baking it . though it has pie in its name , it uses no pie crust , nor is it a pastry . latina ’ s job was to make the mashed potatoes , spread them on a plate with the meat sauce kenneth made , and finally , sprinkle cheese on top . kenneth put it into and took it out of the oven , but latina kept track of how long it baked with a serious look on her face .', 'when it came to flying dragons , the nation held a great deal of authority over things like breeding laws and the maintenance of specialized tools , such as their reins . there were no such things as privatized flying dragon rides . in order to fly a dragon , you had no choice but to act in service of the country . ugh , this is awkward ... ugh , this is awkward ... titi called out “ coo ? coo ? ” apparently worried about her rider , who wasn ’ t acting like himself . it was entirely calm on the back of the flying dragon , despite the whirl of wind mana whipping through the surrounding sky . it was like being in the eye of a hurricane . and yet , the knight deplored that now . if there were at least a gentle breeze , then that would feel good on his sweat-drenched brow . are we really going to go the whole way without talking ? this is so awkward ... are we really going to go the whole way without talking ? this is so awkward ...', 'and aren ’ t the insides leaking out ? “ hey , she ’ s still practicing . it ’ s to be expected . “ practicing ? ” repeated the bearded adventurer , who then realized who ’ d be “ practicing ” in this shop . there was only one possibility , after all . only one little girl lived at this inn , so ... “ the little lady made it , huh ? “ right , it ’ s a work in progress from latina . “ alright , then . leave it here . such exchanges occurred many times over the course of that day . after thinking about what latina could currently handle , kenneth ended up settling on having her make a shepherd ’ s pie . in order to have her improve as quickly as possible , it was best to have her make as many as possible .', 'while he may have been acting irrationally , seeing dale so amusingly agitated actually helped those around him cool down . when dale ’ s panic reached its peak , rita told him what to do , and he immediately flew out of the shop . “ um ... rita ? ” kenneth asked . “ in addition to dale , i also sent word of what latina looks like out about town . and plenty of the gatekeepers are regulars here , so even if someone ’ s dumb enough to try and kidnap her , they ’ ll be stopped at the walls . i get the feeling that even if she is lost , that girl could manage to do something about it on her own , but ... looking at his wife after she sent dale off , kenneth thought that she seemed exceptionally calm . a big reason why rita was able to remain so composed was because latina had gotten lost in an exceptionally safe area , even for the eastern district .', '“ hardly anyone around town can use it . it ’ s pretty much just the people who work at temples or for the feudal lord , or at one of the big companies . outside of that , it ’ s just adventurers , i guess , ” explained the brown-haired boy , anthony , and latina nodded her head to show that she understood . dale ’ s an adventurer . so he can use magic . dale ’ s an adventurer . so he can use magic . and then suddenly , she remembered that she was lost . “ latina is lost ... she doesn ’ t know the way back ... “ where did you come from , latina ? “ the ocelot shop ... in the south ... ” responded the disheartened girl . the children glanced at one another .', 'the warm , fuzzy feeling it gave dale was almost embarrassing . dale had changed quite a bit as well in the brief time since they met . even yesterday , he never would have thought that he could feel this way about a kid . dale went past the counter and through the kitchen . seeing the back of kenneth as he struggled at his work , he called out , “ kenneth , latina says the fruit was tasty . “ right ! ” kenneth responded without turning around as dale passed behind him and towards the stairs in back , where ingredients were piled up . he cut straight across the second floor and climbed a ladder , arriving in the attic . since it was used to stockpile miscellaneous goods to be sold to the adventurers down on the first floor , there was baggage strewn all about ; but even further in was a corner that showed signs of being lived in .', 'the ‘ crime ’ that got her branded with a broken horn must ’ ve been something out of her control . but that ’ s no reason for someone from a different race like me to neglect her . gregor understood that reasoning . what he didn ’ t understand was dale ’ s transformation . didn ’ t just how strongly had that devil girl tugged at his heartstrings ? “ even if latina ’ s a devil , it ’ s not like she sees everyone else as enemies . there ’ s no problem with us living together . “ no problem , huh ... ? in that case , i suppose she doesn ’ t know that you ’ ve slaughtered members of her race , yes ? ” gregor whispered . dale sat in silence for a while . i ’ ve cut down humans for work , too . it hasn ’ t just been devils .', 'even so , the woman pulled out a dagger in an instant , and swung it down at dale in a blow far quicker than that of the warriors . dale didn ’ t falter in the slightest , stopping her attack with his left arm . a dull , metallic sound resounded from his gauntlet , and the knife slid across its surface without leaving so much as a scratch . without even stopping to look at the despair in the woman ’ s eyes , dale slashed his sword to the side . that was how it went . both in tense situations and in battle , dale did nothing that would shame his reputation as a first-rate adventurer . there were no issues with the way he handled his work , either . but in between all of that ... “ maaaaan , i have a serious latina deficiency ! latinaaaaaaaaa ! what is it that you ’ re lacking ?', 'however , he couldn ’ t keep looking for her forever ; he also needed to carry the supplies back to the shop . after asking a number of his acquaintances in the eastern district for their help , he hurriedly returned to the dancing ocelot . after all , that was where her father was , and he was the one who most needed to know the situation . “ yeah , i ’ m really sorry . i took my eyes of her for a second when i was negotiating , and ... kenneth and dale had both let their guard down . latina was an incredibly clever girl , and the two couldn ’ t deny they had unconsciously come to think that she could handle this much . she was well-behaved , so surely she wouldn ’ t wander off . that was just an excuse the adults came up with on their own .', 'having had this question , which he ’ d needed to steel himself to ask , answered with another question , dale at last realized his mistake . latina had fundamentally no words to use for explaining things . “ um , about your family ... did you have any siblings ? “ siblings ? “ kids in your family who have the same parents . a boy would be your brother , while a girl would be your sister , and they can be older or younger than you . that ’ s what ‘ siblings ’ means . “ latina had an older brother and sister . but no younger ones , ” latina responded , having heard dale ’ s explanation . “ what sort of people were the adults ? “ don ’ t know . latina didn ’ t meet other people much , and she didn ’ t talk to them .', '“ friends help each other out , that ’ s how it is ! ” the girl objected in response . latina tilted her small head in confusion . “ i see , so latina ’ s made some friends . it ’ s already a little late today , but you ’ ll have to play plenty with her next time , ” said rita , with a wide and gentle smile on her face , the sort that she didn ’ t usually make . she then opened up the jar of cookies that kenneth had prepared for latina ’ s snacks , and skillfully put together a bundle for each child . “ we really are grateful that you brought latina back . ” on bended knee , so as to meet the children at eye level , she offered these words of thanks alongside the cookies . having an adult like rita act so polite towards them , the children exchanged nervous and fidgety glances , but it seems they didn ’ t entirely dislike the treatment . when chloe and company headed back home , latina stood in the door to the shop , seeing them off by waving her hand .', 'in a district where noble mansions stood in a row , one castle had a clearly different feel to it and stood out from the rest of the luxurious buildings . while it was beautiful and possessed vast grounds , it was also built to be solid and practical . this was the castle of the eldstedt family . the carriage dale was taking rolled onto the grounds of that residence and glided to a gentle stop in front of the entrance . as if they knew the precise time he would arrive , the servants who had been awaiting him opened the doors and greeted him . as he descended from the carriage , dale ’ s expression didn ’ t change in the least . that calm and collected look told of his skill as a first-rate adventurer and left a deep impression on those who saw it . in one room of the residence : “ long time no see , gregor . so , you gon na introduce me to your fiancée ?', 'you ’ re someone very special to him . dale most likely thought of kenneth ’ s place like a bird would think of a tree where it could rest its wings , but that didn ’ t even come close to how important a “ home ” was . to dale , this girl was that important . and so , as his “ big bro , ” it was up to kenneth to protect her while he was away . “ latina is special to dale ? “ yeah , you are . latina ’ s expression was strained , like she was just barely holding back her tears , and she tightly gripped her skirt above her knees . “ kenneth ... “ what is it ?', 'as dale panicked and fell to his knees , speechless , latina shed even more teardrops . “ l-latina ? ! “ l-latina ’ s sorry ... she ’ s sorry ... she ’ s so sorry that she didn ’ t keep her promise ... ” said latina , sobbing convulsively as she apologized . “ dale , are you mad because latina was bad ? “ i ’ m not mad ! not at all ! i was just worried ! ” dale shook his head vigorously , but latina only kept on talking , shaking her head in denial as well . “ it ’ s okay if you ’ re mad . latina was bad , after all ... b-but , latina was scared . she was scared she wouldn ’ t make it back . the tears were now steadily overflowing from her big grey eyes . with the last bit of composure he had left , dale realized that this was the first time he ’ d seen the young girl cry .', 'since latina was carefree and he didn ’ t sense any sort of uneasy gloom from her , dale figured that she wasn ’ t necessarily treated horribly back in her home village . and yet , she had a broken horn . and so she had become possibly the greatest possible sort of target for contempt amongst devils . he had no clue if he was stepping on a landmine here or not . “ um ... latina , did you not ever play with kids around your age before ? “ playing together ? do you mean with family ? “ no , not family . didn ’ t you ever play with kids from other houses ? latina tilted her head in confusion again . “ latina ... only ever had family and adults around .', '“ wow , those look expensive ! can i eat all of them ? “ watch out , latina . rudy really will gobble them all down if you let him . these four were latina ’ s primary playmates . the one who stood at the head of the group and acted as leader was the only girl , chloe . she and latina already got along well enough to be called best friends . for latina , chloe was someone she respected . she firmly and resolutely held the position of power even amongst a group of boys , so latina found her to be truly amazing . and chloe , in turn , thought of latina as a smart girl who knew many things that she didn ’ t . each saw the other as their equal , as someone who had what they lacked . that was why they were able to become so close so quickly , despite their entirely different personalities . or perhaps it should be said that those differences were what actually drew them to one another .', '“ i know , i know . ” dale waved and headed for the room that had been prepared for him . this time , the young man who exited the eldstedt family carriage was clad all in black . it was clear from the wild feel to him that he was no noble , and despite his age , he had the aura of a warrior who ’ d lived through many battles . when the palace guards realized who he was , they stood up straight . the glance he gave the soldier who bowed and stepped forward to guide him was incredibly cool and composed as well . this was a first-rate warrior , who without question wielded his magic and blade mercilessly . he was a prospective hero who was even now achieving great things , and might one day become a legend . that was the sort of man he was rumored to be , and from the impression that he gave , that was no exaggeration .', '“ latina ’ s so cute that i just don ’ t want to go to work ! “ are you still saying that , you moron ? as dale uttered his typical line with a terribly serious look on his face , rita gave her normal , casual response back . “ i don ’ t waaaaaaanna ! i won ’ t make it back tonight , and i don ’ t even know how many days i ’ ll be gone ! how am i supposed to handle leaving latina so i can go deal with those demonic old geezers ? ! supposed', 'instead , they became one upon entering a demon lord ’ s house and gaining power far exceeding what they would naturally possess . and those demons were not necessarily just “ people . ” they also included mythical beasts—beings that possessed high intelligence despite being considered animals . but it was without a doubt the devils that made up the vast majority of the demons , and for that reason , demon lords were also called the “ kings of the devils . “ we ’ ve confirmed the presence of someone who appears to be a subordinate of the seventh demon lord . “ a demon , you mean ? or just a plain old servant ? ” their power would vary greatly depending on if they were a demon or not . in fact , the difference in the threat they represented couldn ’ t even be compared . “ i still don ’ t know for certain . that ’ s why i called for you , ” gregor said , meeting dale ’ s gaze .', 'seeing her so depressed as she earnestly apologized , and knowing that he was at fault , kenneth couldn ’ t bring himself to scold her . he simply felt relieved and patted her tiny head . “ i ’ m glad you ’ re alright . kenneth scooped up the dejected latina in his arms and headed into the shop , where a group of children looked up at him . as kids didn ’ t usually come into the store , kenneth was frankly a little surprised . “ who are they ? “ these kids brought latina back here , ” said rita , having talked to the one girl in the group . “ then we ’ ve got ta give them a reward ... “ friends help each other out , that ’ s how it is !', 'the first time , she still hadn ’ t understood the language at all , so even though she had been interested in her surroundings , she hadn ’ t left dale ’ s side at all . as a result , things had gone fine then . this time , though , she was completely enraptured by the things around her . as it was an important waypoint , kreuz was abundant with all sorts of goods ; it was absolutely overflowing with all sorts of items that latina hadn ’ t seen before and didn ’ t even know how they were used . the various shops , lined up in rows , all had their own ways to grab the attention of passersby . this part of town , which had an entirely different feel compared to the southern district , captured latina ’ s attention . to start with , the girl had curiosity in spades , and she couldn ’ t help that that curiosity won out over her wariness and concentration . thanks to that , she had lost sight of kenneth before she ’ d even realized it . latina promised to stay with kenneth ... will dale be angry ? latina promised to stay with kenneth ... will dale be angry ?', 'gregor and rose had loved one another since they were both young , but there were a great number of issues that stood in the way of them becoming officially engaged . while she was renowned as a beauty without peer , she hadn ’ t yet been used as a pawn in a political marriage and rarely appeared in high society . instead , she silently spent her time in the depths of the estate . she was most definitely one of the reasons that gregor couldn ’ t simply discard his position as a noble . “ what sort of souvenir do you think would be good ? “ souvenirs ... ? you just arrived , but you ’ re already plotting to leave ? “ if it ’ s okay for me to go , then i ’ m outta here . “ a little girl , you said ? did the couple running the place you ’ re renting have a child ?', 'gregor was part of a ducal household , but because he wasn ’ t officially in the employ of the military and was at least partly thought of as an adventurer publicly at this point , the mission had come his way . when dale arrived from kreuz half a month ago and after they ’ d finished their preparations , dale and gregor had headed to their destination alongside the others who were to join them on this mission . all of the members of the party were adventurers who were known to possess extraordinary skills . in addition , because they were being directly contracted by the nation of laband , they were considered every bit as trustworthy as they were skilled . they were no saints , but at the very least there were no worries about any of them becoming a traitor and stabbing their allies in the back . a reconnaissance party from the army disguised as adventurers accompanied them as well . when they at last arrived at a forest deep in the mountains , they were able to confirm that several dragons had made a nest there , just as the scouts had reported .', '“ dale ’ s definitely going to be starving when he comes back . it takes a while to make it from the capital to kreuz , after all . you said that you wanted to learn how to make a meal for him , right ? this is a good opportunity , so i ’ ll help you practice . dale ’ ll be totally shocked and happy when he hears that you made it . latina can do it ? “ it ’ d still be a bit much for you to do everything , but there are parts that you can handle . how about it ? wan na give it a try ? seeing latina brighten up a bit , kenneth felt relieved to the bottom of his heart . for better or worse , it was clear that dale was immensely important to this little girl . “ latina wants to do it . kenneth , please teach latina .', 'and in that way , these children from the eastern district were a godsend . as a result , he casually remarked , “ i ’ m glad you made some friends , latina . her response of , “ what does ‘ friends ’ mean , dale ? ” though , was something he hadn ’ t expected in the least . “ huh ? um ... did you not have any friends before , latina ? latina doesn ’ t really understand what ‘ friends ’ means . chloe also said latina was her friend , but latina doesn ’ t get it . as latina tilted her head in confusion , dale let out a , “ hmm ... since latina was carefree and he didn ’ t sense any sort of uneasy gloom from her , dale figured that she wasn ’ t necessarily treated horribly back in her home village .', '“ chloe ! ” yelled latina , vigorously waving and running towards the girl . the southern district of kreuz , where latina lived , was both a rougher neighborhood where commoners lived , as well as a location for shops that served adventurers and travelers . for the most part , it wasn ’ t a suitable place for children to play . there were affordable inns that served people with no questions asked , as well as bars where adventurers who failed to get work would drink themselves into a stupor from the middle of the day on , and even shops that stank of cheap perfumes used to satisfy the desires of men . those were the sorts of businesses that surrounded the dancing ocelot . as a result , latina was only allowed to go out alone on the southern district ’ s main street and the path from the dancing ocelot that led there . fortunately , the dancing ocelot was positioned close to the center of the southern district .', 'though the saddle on a flying dragon was far , far higher up than it would be on a horse , the young man easily pulled himself up without losing his balance . as he fastened his belt to finish preparing for flight , it was clear that he was used to the process . the dragon knight hurried to his own saddle and grasped the reins . these reins were made from a special material that could easily transmit his mana . by grasping them , the knight could give detailed instructions to his dragon , and they also conveyed the dragon ’ s thoughts back to him . it was a dragon knight ’ s most important and precious piece of equipment . “ let ’ s go , titi , ” he said , delivering the short command with his mana . following his instruction , the dragon spread out her wings , let out a peculiar cry of “ coo-loo-loo , ” and gathered up the wind mana from the area . coo-loo-loo , using both the wind mana that enveloped her and the traits she possessed as a natural-born flier , the dragon lifted her giant frame off the ground with a single flap of her wings .', '“ ocelot ? “ there aren ’ t that many shops in the south . “ could it be that one ? the one with the green flags . “ that shop for adventurers ? hearing those words , latina ’ s expression brightened up . “ yeah . lots of adventurers come to the shop . with that response , the children looked at each other again . a shop for adventurers was a dangerous place where people who took on hazardous work gathered . their parents had forbidden them from playing in that part of the southern district . but this was to help someone out . this definitely wasn ’ t just because they wanted to go see .', 'when they at last arrived at laband ’ s capital , ausblick , the flying dragon began its descent . after the dragon knight communicated with a soldier on the ground using the light from magical devices , they landed on a dedicated platform . as you could be shot down if you approached the capital carelessly , it was necessary to follow the proper procedures . once he set foot on the ground , dale approached the carriage that was waiting for him as always , not even bothering to so much as glance back at the dragon or the knight . the driver opened the carriage door for him without needing to ask who he was . though it wasn ’ t overly flashy , there wasn ’ t anyone in the capital who wouldn ’ t recognize the family crest that was affixed to this luxurious coach .', 'a big reason why rita was able to remain so composed was because latina had gotten lost in an exceptionally safe area , even for the eastern district . she then faced the various adventurers engrossed in idle talk about the shop . “ anyone who helps out with the search drinks for free tonight . and if you find her , then i ’ ll give you a reward . even if you don ’ t find her , be sure to come back here by the hour of saj—before sunset . how does that sound ? “ well , i guess it ’ ll kill some time . “ it wouldn ’ t be so bad having dale owe me one , either . saying such things in response , the regulars got up out of their seats . latina was becoming a special person to the regulars as well .', 'after thinking on dale ’ s words for a while , latina ’ s expression lit up . “ latina likes chloe , too . she ’ s glad chloe called latina her friend . “ i see . seeing the happy look on her face made dale worry a little as he patted latina ’ s head . he thought he should ask the meaning of what she said before , so he chose his words carefully and spoke . what sort of people were you around before ? “ latina doesn ’ t know . how should she put it ? having had this question , which he ’ d needed to steel himself to ask , answered with another question , dale at last realized his mistake .', 'hey , gregor , what ’ s the job this time around ? let ’ s head out right away . i can leave if i wipe everything out immediately , yeah ? “ what the hell ’ s happened to you ? gregor ’ s reaction was totally natural , after all . the last time he ’ d seen dale , he wasn ’ t like this . this just what in the world had happened to bring him to such a deplorable state ? the cause seemed to be the child who had come up all throughout the current conversation . just where had she come from ? when gregor carelessly asked those questions , he lost any chance he had of stopping his friend from gleefully talking away . he was completely bewildered and hadn ’ t the slightest idea as to how he should react . and just when would he stop bragging about his kid ?', 'this definitely wasn ’ t just because they wanted to go see . ultimately , forbidding children from doing something only makes them more interested . this occurred in the southern district a little before latina opened up to the children in the eastern district : “ latina ’ s lost ? ! ” a shriek so loud it even reached outside the shop emanated from the dancing ocelot . when kenneth realized latina wasn ’ t there , he had hurriedly looked everywhere for her . but by then , she was already nowhere to be found . however , he couldn ’ t keep looking for her forever ; he also needed to carry the supplies back to the shop .', 'even just from seeing her skip along , it was obvious that the young girl was enjoying herself . her beautiful platinum hair , which was tied up in brilliant blue ribbons , swayed side to side along with her movements , occasionally shining in the light . she seemed to have grown quite fond of her light-blue , plaid dress as of late , and sure enough , she picked it out of the small white wicker basket to wear again today . her expression brightened further when she saw her friends playing in the plaza .', 'in kreuz , several days after dale left for the capital : it was readily apparent that latina was miserable . rather than just feeling down , she was full-on wallowing in sorrow . it was like her whole body was screaming out that she was lonely . “ latina ... are you alright ? ” no matter how kenneth looked at it , she clearly wasn ’ t , but he couldn ’ t think of anything else to say to her . “ latina ’ s alright ... she ’ s holding down the fort , after all , ” latina responded as she sat quietly next to kenneth while he was doing his usual preparations .', 'the look on her face grew serious , and she thrust her tiny hand out towards him . she moistened her lips and carefully began a chant . “ oh light of heaven , grant this request by my name , and please heal those who have been wounded . 〈〈healing light〉〉 ” a gentle light flowed out from latina ’ s hand , causing the other children ’ s eyes to go wide . latina then used the same recovery magic on rudy as well , and then , with a frown on her face , she suddenly sat down . “ are you alright ? “ latina ’ s alright . just a little tired , ” she answered chloe with a smile . taking that as their chance , the boys excitedly crowded around latina .', 'with that , dale remembered that devils were a race with a long lifespan and a low birthrate . there wouldn ’ t be many kids around in the first place . “ hmm ... friends refer to people other than your family who you can play and talk with . they ’ re usually around the same age as you . ” he added the last part so she wouldn ’ t think of him , rita , and kenneth as her “ friends . ” “ and out of those sorts of people , they ’ re the ones who come to like you . he couldn ’ t really say that was the way the world worked , but he wanted to raise this honest child while letting her think that . that ’ s what dale thought . “ chloe likes latina ? “ i doubt anybody would want to become friends with someone they weren ’ t fond of .', '“ oh , it ’ s you , rita . where ’ s latina ? “ latina ’ s with kenneth , ” she answered . just then , apparently hearing the ruckus , the person in question suddenly poked her tiny head out from inside the shop . latina broke out in a brilliant smile and came running to his side . “ dale , welcome back ! ! compared to how she ’ d looked half a month prior , latina had filled back out to a size closer to an average child , and now she appeared even more adorable than dale remembered . “ i ’ m home , latina ! you did a great job holding down the fort . were you lonely ? i ’ m so sorry . i was super lonely , too !', 'and yet , she was still pretty sleepy . it would be rather dangerous to let her try to go down the stairs like this , even more so considering their room was in the attic and reached via ladder . dale lifted her up with a strained smile . even though not too much time had passed since they first met , he could tell that she ’ d managed to regain a relieving amount of weight . latina was currently still half-asleep and kept nodding off , then forcing herself back awake . “ i ’ m sorry , latina ... you ’ re going to be holding down the fort for a bit . do you think you can handle it ? feeling dale ’ s palm on her back , her eyes shot open , and she responded with a serious look of determination on her face .', '“ chloe , and marcel , and all of them are going , because they ’ re the same age , ” said latina , looking up at dale from his lap . looking back at her , he thought back on her friends . he ’ d figured they were a bit older than latina and thought of the young girl as someone to dote on . “ she asked if latina wants to go too , because she ’ s also the same age . it took dale a bit of time to digest those words . what ? “ apparently , it ’ s true , ” said kenneth with a nod as dale looked towards him for an explanation . “ latina , your birthday ’ s next month , right ?', 'the duke had dispatched a flying dragon just for this man who lived in kreuz , so it was abundantly clear how much he was favored . titi , he ’ s here ! worrying for her master , the dragon gave a “ coo ” to show that she understood . coo a young man in a long black leather coat approached as the morning sun shone behind him . the dull , metallic sparkle coming from his left arm must have been his gauntlet-shaped magical device . he also wore a longsword at his waist , making him a perfect fit for the description that the dragon knight had been given . this young adventurer was skilled enough that he could cut down even the knight ’ s partner , titi , with a single swing of his sword .', 'he was just blowing off steam , or at least that ’ s what gregor decided , choosing the most favorable explanation possible for his friend ’ s actions . that was his small bit of pity towards the poor man . and now , gregor ’ s greatest task was to stop dale before he amassed a mountain of souvenirs so huge that it would be too much for a flying dragon to carry . “ latina ! ! ” dale screamed out in joy as he flung open the door to the dancing ocelot . in his other hand he held his luggage , which had clearly increased since when he ’ d left . “ that ’ s the first thing that comes out of your mouth ? that ’ s ” rita responded , disgusted that that was all he ’ d have to say upon seeing her for the first time in half a month . he ’ d clearly gotten worse in that span of time , in pretty much every way .', '” in that cute voice of hers . definitely . there was no doubt . she may even throw in an “ i love you , dale ! ” what should he do ? she was just too cute ! he may even be able to survive on that cuteness alone . “ i think i may be able to give it my all . “ yeah , right . good for you , ” said rita , who had already returned to work and was no longer looking at him . on the morning of the day that dale was heading to the capital , latina got up early to see him off . the morning sun hadn ’ t completely risen yet , and it was long before she would normally wake up . “ don ’ t push yourself . how about just going back to sleep ? ” dale told her , but she shook her head and crawled out of bed .', 'latina wasn ’ t overly fond of rudy ( his real name was rudolf , but his friends called him by this nickname ) . their first meeting had left a poor impression , and even afterwards , he kept picking on the devil girl and playing tricks on her . this was always followed by a harsh counterattack from chloe , but he showed no sign of learning his lesson whatsoever . having not had much interaction with kids her own age , latina didn ’ t quite know how to deal with rudy , who was easily the most childish one in the group . having been born and raised in kreuz , the four children were well known around town , so as long as latina was following after them , she was easily accepted , even into groups of kids she ’ d never met . and so , latina was able to play together with friends for the first time ever . “ what should we play today ?', 'in response to chloe and marcel ’ s questions , latina happily reported , “ dale came back ! “ that so ? “ good for you , latina . latina ’ s friends had seen how deeply depressed she was when her dad was away . these were honest words of congratulations at seeing their tiny friend finally able to smile from the depths of her heart again . “ dale said these are souvenirs for everyone . wan na have a snack ? latina smiled and held out a basket packed with sweets . rudy realized it was food and stared gleefully at it , which made anthony give a sarcastic laugh .', 'latina promised to stay with kenneth ... will dale be angry ? latina promised to stay with kenneth ... will dale be angry ? she thought , becoming more and more depressed . clearly at a loss , she didn ’ t know at all what to do . latina may never see him again . what should she do ? latina may never see him again . what should she do ? she didn ’ t want to be left alone again . even though she was surrounded by so many people , she couldn ’ t help but feel tormented by an overwhelming feeling of isolation . she couldn ’ t stop herself from thinking that these were bad people . latina hates this ... what should she do ? if she doesn ’ t make it back ... if she doesn ’ t get back ... latina hates this ... what should she do ? if she doesn ’ t make it back ... if she doesn ’ t get back ... her mind was spinning in circles with such thoughts . though she was smart , latina was still young , so her being driven by emotion rather than logic was a natural reaction . but right now , there was no one to tell her that .', '—this young girl may have waited on customers more politely than anyone else at this shop . take your time , said the regulars in unison deep in their hearts , as latina wore a smile on her face and hugged the now-empty tray . take your time , the gruff men who made up the regulars were clearly perplexed at first as to how they should interact with a young girl like latina , who would shoot even them a lovely smile . normally a child would break out in tears if they came into contact with people like them , so they ’ d never really had such a charming girl smile at them the way that latina did . occasionally , she ’ d come across someone foolish enough to act rudely towards her , perhaps because they were in a bad mood . when it came to adventurers , guys like that would be considered less than second-rate .', 'the brown-haired boy swiftly distanced himself , but the other two fell victim to chloe ’ s punches . latina stopped panicking and absentmindedly stared in admiration at the girl . her intervention had rescued latina .', 'with that signal , gregor , holding a scarlet , eastern longsword in his grasp , leaped into action as well . the blade had been enhanced with magic to strengthen its sharpness , and the shine coming off of it danced through the air . when it came to pure sword technique , gregor was on a whole other level compared to dale . “ oh earth , by my name , i order you to strike my foes . 〈〈stone spears〉〉 ” in the instant that all attention had gathered on gregor , dale chanted this close-range attack spell . this sort of coordination was only possible because they both knew intimately how the other fought . sharp spears made of stone rose from the ground with such precision that it was hard to believe that this spell was the result of such a simple chant . having been thrown off-balance , the devil warriors were then cut down by gregor .', 'though the round-faced boy tried to stop him , rudy kept stomping towards latina . now completely in a panic , her face turning pale , latina tried to flee . “ why are you running ? ! you ’ re acting fishy ! however , due to the difference in their physiques , rudy soon overtook and captured her . hearing the yell that latina let out the second rudy grabbed her arm left the boys stupefied . “ what did she say ? “ maybe she ’ s a foreigner ...', 'when they at last arrived at a forest deep in the mountains , they were able to confirm that several dragons had made a nest there , just as the scouts had reported . as it was a land awash in the blessing of ahmar , ausblick was a geothermal hotspot and also an area dragons frequently used during breeding season . those are definitely dragons that serve the seventh demon lord . especially fond of war and mayhem , the seventh demon lord liked to employ dragons as a symbol of his great power . devils had a high number of those with an affinity for center magic , including tamers who could manipulate dragons as if they were an extension of themselves . by confirming those dragons were targets , they also confirmed the presence of a tamer . there was one woman in a black robe , as well as a number of warriors . each and every one of them had horns on their heads .', 'as the boys glanced at each other , they had already lost all their anger , leaving behind only confusion . but because latina was still panicking , she didn ’ t realize that . desperately twisting about , she screamed , “ ** , ** ! “ what are you doing ? ! a girl about the same age as the boys came flying out of a nearby house at the sound of latina ’ s screaming . as soon as she saw latina ’ s ghostly pale face , she leaped right at the boys . “ you ’ re the absolute worst , picking on such a little girl ! “ gah ! cut it out , chloe ! “ you got it all wrong !', 'the knight had no confidence that he ’ d be able to withstand nearly half a day of this silent pressure . feeling the presence of the man behind him , his throat went bone-dry . he reached underneath his own saddle and took something out . as he ’ d grown accustomed to doing so , he was able to skillfully remove the contents with a single hand and pop one into his mouth . there was no deep meaning to his actions when he kept on going and offered the container to the man behind him . in fact , in his current state , the dragon knight was unable to consider the deep meaning of anything at all . “ would you care to try some , sir ? candy ? completely petrified , he cried out in a quiet voice , i ’ m done foooooooor ! ! i ’ m done foooooooor ! !', 'watching her pace back and forth to the entrance of the shop , he became depressed as well . seeing latina acting differently than she usually did made not only the regulars who knew what was going on but also the customers who didn ’ t know anything just keep drinking in silence . that was the sort of mood in the shop when dale at last returned . when he opened the door , he was out of breath and dripping in sweat . “ rita ! what ’ s happened since i ... ? ” while asking if there was any new information , he suddenly realized that the person in question was staring up at him . “ latina ! her response to dale calling out her name in joy was a flow of tears .', 'considering the circumstances , gregor ’ s chances of becoming his father ’ s successor had quickly evaporated . thanks to the strong influence of his mother ’ s blood , gregor was a fearless-looking young man with straight black hair ( currently tied up in a ponytail ) , and he had a strong foreign feel to his appearance . he was half a head taller than dale , and today his slender body was dressed in high-class clothing befitting a noble , which was unusual for him . while gregor diligently studied his own nation , he also polished his foreign sword techniques , and he had his eye on possibly using his sword skills to become an adventurer in the near future . as he wasn ’ t particularly attached to his position as a noble , he felt no need to force himself to become part of some other household .', '“ we were gon na play a game of octopus tag . “ it ’ ll be with those kids over there . you wan na come along too , latina ? “ yeah ! the four taught latina how to play . it was a variant on normal tag where you ’ d join hands with whoever was “ it ” when they caught you , and then chase after the others together . it was best enjoyed as a large group . with latina having joined them , the group of five rushed over to where the other children were playing in the park . it was a sign of kreuz ’ s prosperity and wholesome nature that children were able to run about while joyfully shouting like this in its streets .', 'his current mission was to escort that adventurer to the capital . despite the adventurer ’ s young age , he ’ d already racked up some impressive achievements and possessed a great deal of influence , as he held the favor of the duke who served as the prime minister , the right-hand man of the king of laband . even though he was ultimately just an adventurer favored by the duke , if the knight upset him , the duke would hear about it right away . normally , the nation ’ s leading authorities would pay no heed to the words of a mere adventurer , but apparently this adventurer was an exception . this rumor had it that the previous dragon knight had made light of this adventurer because of how young he was , and that had earned the knight the wrath of his superiors . he ’ d been sent off to the frontier by order of the duke himself .', '“ latina was lonely , but she ’ s happy that you made it home safely . welcome back ! ” latina said with a smile as dale hugged her tight . “ ah , you really do bring me solace , latina ... ” dale muttered in response , awash in a flood of emotions . i gave it my all , and it was so very worth it . i gave it my all , and it was so very worth it . “ actually , latina , i got you souvenirs ... “ hold on , dale . dale had been excitedly preparing to give her the souvenirs , only for latina to now quickly push away , leaving him in shock . as he saw her hurry with fast , little footsteps to kenneth in the kitchen , his face showed that he was clearly stricken with grief . his eyes lost all focus , and he hollowly murmured , “ h-half a month was too long , huh ... ?', 'it was a sign of kreuz ’ s prosperity and wholesome nature that children were able to run about while joyfully shouting like this in its streets . there was nothing to really endanger the children here in the middle of the day , despite the heavy flow of travelers through town . part of that was because the plaza was near the lord ’ s manor , where the local government was run . kreuz did have slums , though to be precise they were actually outside the walls and clustered up against them . there were children in the town itself who lived rather poorly as well , being forced to work from a young age , but even so , the overwhelming majority of children there were able to have fun , play , and just enjoy their childhood , perhaps more so than any other town in laband . after playing numerous games of octopus tag and running around to the point of exhaustion , the children naturally dispersed . after saying goodbye to the other kids , latina and her friends sat down off to the side in the grass , where they pulled out the contents of the basket .', 'in kreuz , several days after dale left for the capital : it was readily apparent that latina was miserable . rather than just feeling down , she was full-on wallowing in sorrow . it was like her whole body was screaming out that she was lonely . “ latina ... are you alright ? ” no matter how kenneth looked at it , she clearly wasn ’ t , but he couldn ’ t think of anything else to say to her . “ latina ’ s alright ... she ’ s holding down the fort , after all , ” latina responded as she sat quietly next to kenneth while he was doing his usual preparations .', 'this meant it only involved people who were trusted enough to settle their bills at the end , so latina was able to do the job without needing to handle the money . as a result , the dancing ocelot underwent an unprecedented shepherd ’ s pie boom . “ thanks for waiting ! it certainly wasn ’ t a bad thing to see latina enthusiastically give this her all , especially considering how she ’ d been hanging her head in sadness since dale left . whenever she was feeling lonely , an aura of depression hung over the dancing ocelot . there was a rather nice-looking shepherd ’ s pie on top of the tray that latina was carefully carrying out . it was still just a little bit sloppy , but it would be no problem to serve it on the menu at this point . “ it ’ s hot , so be careful , please .', 'with the last bit of composure he had left , dale realized that this was the first time he ’ d seen the young girl cry . “ latina doesn ’ t wan na be alone again , dale ... it ’ s fine if you ’ re mad at latina , but she wants to stay with you ... apparently , latina had thought on this a lot after she ’ d made it back to the dancing ocelot . during that time , she must have remembered the helplessness and anxiety she ’ d felt when she was lost , leaving her awash in strong emotions . she felt she absolutely needed to apologize , but once she had , she was swept away by that feeling of unease ... or at least , that was what dale guessed later on , after he calmed down . for now , as he was a complete and utter wreck , all he could do was hug the sobbing latina tight . at this point , the fact that she was already sobbing became her reason for crying more .', 'perhaps because of her experience in the forest , where she had to take care of herself rather than waiting for someone to save her , she didn ’ t realize that the best thing to do when you ’ re lost is to wait in one spot . latina took a guess at the direction she should go and started running . if she had stayed put just a little longer , she would ’ ve seen kenneth return in a panic . latina ended up turning several corners and entering a block she ’ d genuinely never seen before . where is this ? there was no way that she could ’ ve known , but this area was known for having a particularly high concentration of artisans , even for the eastern district . lined up one after another were houses that served both as residences and workshops .', 'she ’ s holding down the fort , after all , ” latina responded as she sat quietly next to kenneth while he was doing his usual preparations . her voice sounded like it was about to vanish . she was always like that . even though latina ’ s expression and body language told otherwise , her response was that of an anxious honor student . kenneth let out a sigh and looked at her . “ yeah , that ’ s right . you ’ re holding down the fort . and dale will definitely come back , because you ’ re waiting for him . latina looked up at kenneth and tilted her head a little , and kenneth responded with a smile . if an adult like him looked glum too , then that would only make latina more uneasy . “ before you came , dale just saw this as a place to leave his things . but now it ’ s a ‘ home ’ for him to return to . ” kenneth knew dale very well .', 'still , latina ended up talking to me about herself like this ... just what would happen if dale found out ... ? still , latina ended up talking to me about herself like this ... just what would happen if dale found out ... ? he ’ d be a real pain , and it certainly wouldn ’ t be fun to see . dale really needed to learn from this girl ’ s concern for others , even if only just a bit . “ hey , latina , do you want to try learning something before dale gets back ? learning ? kenneth suddenly suggested this because he was worried that otherwise , she ’ d just stay depressed and wilting away until dale returned . it would be better to give her something else to focus on . of course , the greatest possible motivation for latina was dale .', 'at this point , the fact that she was already sobbing became her reason for crying more . for a time , she couldn ’ t talk and just kept on weeping . as latina continued to cry , dale was only able to keep himself together because he knew that this would eventually end when she tired herself out . dale held latina in his arms as she became exhausted and nodded off , and the nearby customers shot him strained smiles . this was the moment that a new drinking tale for the shop , which would later come to be called the “ panic and wailing incident , ” was born . after that day , latina began playing with the children from the eastern district . the shop in the southern district faced out on the street , and it had a more wholesome feel to it than the other stores that served adventurers .', 'naturally , adults and children had differing points of view . to start with , the way they saw the world was not the same . adult thinking could not grasp how children behaved . “ ah , no , it ’ s ... she ’ s already lost , so no matter what we do now , what ’ s done is done . it ’ s ... aaaaaagh ! if this was going to happen , then i should ’ ve learned some search magic ! apologize to latina , past-me , for saying that stuff was unnecessary ! i ’ m sorry , i ’ m sorry , i ’ m sorry ... no , that ’ s right . right now , latina ’ s ... what should i do ? what should i do ? oh , i-if i send out a request , then i can have the adventurers in town look for her ! ” dale went on and on and on . “ how about going to look for her , to start with ? ” said rita . “ that ’ s it !', 'did the couple running the place you ’ re renting have a child ? “ no , she ’ s mine . gregor froze , but dale didn ’ t realize it in the least . his thoughts were solely on the vision of latina ’ s smile . “ she ’ s a great kid , and she ’ s just way , way , waaaaaaay too cute . and she ’ s super admirable , too . she ’ s bravely watching the place back home right now . she told me to ‘ take care ’ as she waved her tiny little hand . i feel like i ’ m gon na cry just remembering it . ugh , i wan na hurry on back to her . is she lonely right now ? what ’ ll i do if i ’ ve made her cry ? plus , she ’ s still growing . she ’ s learning new things each and every day . will she learn to do even more things while i ’ m gone ? what should i do ? it ’ s utter torture , missing out on latina growing up . yeah , i ’ m heading back . i ’ ll leave right now . hey , gregor , what ’ s the job this time around ?', '“ hmm ? yes , latina is seven . “ you ’ re so little , latina ... ” dale commented . kenneth agreed . “ yeah , she is . “ latina is little ? all of the adults had thought she was five or six . latina was just that small . still , now that dale thought about it , latina ’ s words and actions had been surprisingly sharp , considering the age they ’ d thought she was . the way she spoke made her seem young , but she had only just picked up the language , so it was a result of a lack of grammar and vocabulary skills . she ’ d be eight soon . when children were that young , age differences of a year or two had a huge effect .', 'even just from seeing her skip along , it was obvious that the young girl was enjoying herself . her beautiful platinum hair , which was tied up in brilliant blue ribbons , swayed side to side along with her movements , occasionally shining in the light . she seemed to have grown quite fond of her light-blue , plaid dress as of late , and sure enough , she picked it out of the small white wicker basket to wear again today . her expression brightened further when she saw her friends playing in the plaza .', 'that was the sort of man he was rumored to be , and from the impression that he gave , that was no exaggeration . while feeling the somewhat jealous gazes of the soldiers , gregor felt conflicted—somehow relieved and somehow not—seeing the “ usual ” dale next to him . this was the man named dale reki . this when someone first met him , they ’ d say he was charming and calm , but if they were to meet him on the field of battle , they ’ d find a cool-headed , yet unforgiving warrior . it was said that perhaps the young dale had needed to become that way in order to succeed at such work . the best way to calmly deal with what he saw was to kill off his own emotions . that was how he seemed to the soldier who guided him through the palace with his back still perfectly straight .', 'or perhaps it should be said that those differences were what actually drew them to one another . rather than feeling jealous , they respected one another instead . latina had also quickly grown close to the boy known as marcel , who had a gentle personality and a round face that was just a tad on the plump side . as he was always kind to latina and was careful not to frighten her , he was the girl ’ s second favorite , after chloe . if asked about the slender , brown-haired boy named anthony , latina would say that she didn ’ t know him all that well . but it at least seemed that she didn ’ t dislike him . he was the sort of kid that chloe would call shrewd , while adults would say he had his head on straight . and then finally , there was the tallest boy in the group . latina wasn ’ t overly fond of rudy ( his real name was rudolf , but his friends called him by this nickname ) .', 'so , you gon na introduce me to your fiancée ? “ hmph , very well , dale . so you wish me to cut you down , then ? with that reprehensible exchange , the elegant atmosphere evaporated . right now , they were in gregor ’ s personal chamber . as if reflecting its owner ’ s personality , the high quality of the first-class furnishings was almost palpable , but the interior design was utterly lacking in splendor . gregor was the third son of the duke and was his youngest child . however , unlike his siblings , he was the son of the duke ’ s second wife , and because she was a foreigner from a remote eastern nation , his backing within the country was rather weak . the first son , who was noticeably older than him , had already married and had a child . considering the circumstances , gregor ’ s chances of becoming his father ’ s successor had quickly evaporated .', '“ the bottle is a work of art too , isn ’ t it ? the detailed design extends even to the lid . and apparently , it ’ s become popular with women and children to use the empty bottle to hold small items ! furthermore , since it comes in small , medium , and large sizes , it makes for a great gift that can be tailored to suit your budget and needs . they ’ re perfect for any type of consumer ! ” as the dragon knight desperately spouted off lines that made him sound like a candy salesman , he wondered what he would see if he turned around . thinking about it , i ’ ve actually never bought candy for latina before . if she put one in her mouth , her little cheeks would puff out , right ? and the colors are pretty , which seems like the sort of thing that ’ d make a girl happy . when i bought latina hair accessories , she was fixated on the sparkly ones . even if she ’ s tiny , she ’ s still a girl , so i ’ m sure she ’ d like them . oh right , one of latina ’ s friends is a girl , too . i ’ ll need to get some for her as well . latina would probably be happy if she and her friend got the same thing . and then ... thinking about it , i ’ ve actually never bought candy for latina before . if she put one in her mouth , her little cheeks would puff out , right ? and the colors are pretty , which seems like the sort of thing that ’ d make a girl happy . when i bought latina hair accessories , she was fixated on the sparkly ones . even if she ’ s tiny , she ’ s still a girl , so i ’ m sure she ’ d like them . oh right , one of latina ’ s friends is a girl , too . i ’ ll need to get some for her as well . latina would probably be happy if she and her friend got the same thing . and then ...', 'though it wasn ’ t overly flashy , there wasn ’ t anyone in the capital who wouldn ’ t recognize the family crest that was affixed to this luxurious coach . the ducal house eldstedt were descendants of the king who founded the nation , and they had married into the royal family many times in the past , making them a line of foremost pedigree in laband . they weren ’ t overly haughty , despite being famous for producing talented heirs one after another , with the present duke serving as the current prime minister . it would be no exaggeration to say that they were the second-greatest authority in the nation . it was precisely because the king and the duke were able to focus on governing together rather than pandering to one another that the country was so unwaveringly powerful . in a district where noble mansions stood in a row , one castle had a clearly different feel to it and stood out from the rest of the luxurious buildings .', '“ latina , i said . i ’ ve had way too little latina lately ... . ” dale said in a strange voice as he suddenly flailed . “ i wan na see latina ... how is she doing ... ? ” he asked when he was gazing up at the sky , tears streaming down his face . “ latina ... ” he muttered when he was stirring a campfire . to sum it up , he was emotionally unstable . the others grew distant from him as a result . after all , these attacks generally came as fits , and anyone who was dragged into them found it nothing but uncomfortable . he was just blowing off steam , or at least that ’ s what gregor decided , choosing the most favorable explanation possible for his friend ’ s actions .', '” kenneth knew dale very well . after all , kenneth was the one who had taught him the basics of being an adventurer back when dale was still a mere boy who ’ d only just left his village . kenneth had brought him into his party and freely taught him everything from traveling basics to how to accept jobs , as well as all sorts of techniques for dealing with magical beasts . as his guide , kenneth knew how much having a “ big bro ” to rely on could help give strength to someone setting out on their own , without any friends to support them . “ dale always tells you ‘ i ’ m home , ’ right , latina ? that ’ s proof that this is home for him now . “ dale always tells latina ‘ i ’ m home ’ ? “ that ’ s right . but he never said that before you came . you ’ re someone very special to him .', '“ so ... you took in a devil child with one horn ? after he ’ d heard the story of how dale adopted latina and all the details of what had happened up until now , gregor had lost track of just how many times the word “ cute ” had been used . although he realized early in the conversation that it was prudent to just take the whole thing in stride , he had a dumbfounded look on his face as he listened to the unexpected tale . but dale didn ’ t seem to be paying attention to his listener ’ s reaction . as he was now , discussing latina ’ s cuteness to his heart ’ s content was a matter of great importance . “ i ’ d like to have you meet latina , too , but ... i couldn ’ t handle it if the royal family found out how cute she is and set their sights on her . yeah . there ’ s no way , then . if you want to meet her , then you ’ ve got ta come to our place .', 'in kreuz , several days after dale left for the capital : it was readily apparent that latina was miserable . rather than just feeling down , she was full-on wallowing in sorrow . it was like her whole body was screaming out that she was lonely . “ latina ... are you alright ? ” no matter how kenneth looked at it , she clearly wasn ’ t , but he couldn ’ t think of anything else to say to her . “ latina ’ s alright ... she ’ s holding down the fort , after all , ” latina responded as she sat quietly next to kenneth while he was doing his usual preparations .', '“ oh earth and the spirits dwelling within you , by my name of dale reki i order you , shift your form according to my wishes , and swallow up all around you . 〈〈ground transfiguration〉〉 ” the mana called forth by this chant vastly eclipsed that of a basic spell . a thunderous roar filled the air , and the ground beneath his target collapsed . the demon woman and warriors realized the attack was coming in time to get out of the way , but the heavy dragons were caught up in the thick of it . if dale were a normal magic user , it wouldn ’ t have been strange for this attack to exhaust him completely , but he didn ’ t show even a hint of fatigue . in fact , he had smoothly unsheathed his blade , and cut his way into the midst of his confused enemies . with that signal , gregor , holding a scarlet , eastern longsword in his grasp , leaped into action as well .', 'and knowing that latina ’ s waiting for me , that ’ ll motivate me more than ever . plus , latina seems to have made some friends , so that should help keep her distracted while she ’ s holding down the fort ... so i get it , already ! he clenched his fists tightly and his knuckles turned white , as if to show how deep the emotions driving the action were . “ but still , i just don ’ t wan na ! wan na ah , he really was pathetic . in response to dale ’ s outpouring , rita looked at him as if to say he was a hopeless case . “ if you get that there ’ s nothing you can do about it , then how about bringing latina back a souvenir that you think she ’ ll like from the capital ?', 'the girl was in a pinch . “ what should latina do ? she worriedly glanced about at the people coming and going . right now , she wasn ’ t in the southern district of kreuz , where she lived . she had accompanied kenneth when he went out to replenish stock , and had come to the eastern district . this was only her second time visiting this part of town . the first time , she still hadn ’ t understood the language at all , so even though she had been interested in her surroundings , she hadn ’ t left dale ’ s side at all .', 'since kenneth was the one who made the meat sauce , which was the main flavor , there weren ’ t any huge failures . but still , the results were slightly awkward at the start , with sauce dripping out the sides , or the potatoes coming out lumpy . but as the days went by , latina continued to improve . after the first day , the regulars all readied themselves to help with latina ’ s practice without a single word from kenneth . after all , this dish came with the bonus of a tiny waitress carrying it out . latina had wanted to help wait the tables for a while now , but the ocelot had customers pay their bill when they got their food , so it wasn ’ t like they could have a young girl like her handle it . but this shepherd ’ s pie campaign was limited to just the regulars . this meant it only involved people who were trusted enough to settle their bills at the end , so latina was able to do the job without needing to handle the money .', '“ latina , your birthday ’ s next month , right ? ” asked dale . “ yeah . “ is that right ? i ’ ll need get some presents ready , then ! “ go ahead and tell dale how old you ’ ll be , ” said kenneth encouragingly . “ hmm ? latina will be eight , ” she replied , tilting her head as if to say she didn ’ t know why she was being asked . for a moment , dale was frozen stiff and at a loss for words . seeing that reaction , kenneth nodded his head . so you ’ re seven right now , latina ? ” continued kenneth .']\n"
